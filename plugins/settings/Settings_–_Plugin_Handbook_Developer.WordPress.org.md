# Settings – Plugin Handbook | Developer.WordPress.org

WordPress provides two core APIs to make the administrative interfaces easy to build, secure, and consistent with the design of WordPress Administration.

The [Settings API](https://developer.wordpress.org/plugins/settings/settings-api/) focuses on providing a way for developers to create forms and manage form data.

The [Options API](https://developer.wordpress.org/plugins/settings/options-api/) focuses on managing data using a simple key/value system.

## Quick Reference

See the complete example of [building a custom settings page](https://developer.wordpress.org/plugins/settings/custom-settings-page/) using the Settings API and Options API.
