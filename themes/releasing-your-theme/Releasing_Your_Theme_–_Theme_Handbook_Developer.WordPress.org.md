# Releasing Your Theme – Theme Handbook

This section covers the requirements and submission process for releasing your theme into the [WordPress Theme Directory](https://wordpress.org/themes/). If you’ve followed the instructions in this handbook, your theme is almost ready for release into the directory.

The first requirement to releasing your theme is to make sure you have – at a minimum – the [required theme files](https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/release/required-theme-files/) before submitting your theme for review.

Once you’ve confirmed the required theme files, thorough [testing](https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/release/testing/) of the theme – including content – must be completed. Following the [theme review guidelines](https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/release/theme-review-guidelines/) will help ensure acceptance of your theme.

After completing everything above, having the proper [documentation](https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/release/writing-documentation/) is the final step before [submitting your theme for approval](https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/release/submitting-your-theme-to-wordpress-org/). After submitting your theme for review, the theme reviewer may request other changes to your theme.
