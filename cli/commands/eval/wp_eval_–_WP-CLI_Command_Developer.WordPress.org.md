# wp eval – WP-CLI Command

[![GitHub](https://make.wordpress.org/cli/wp-content/plugins/wporg-cli/assets/images/github-mark.svg)](https://github.com/wp-cli/eval-command)

This command runs on the `before_wp_load` hook, just before the WP load process begins. Note: because code is executed within a method, global variables need to be explicitly globalized.

### [Options](#options)

<php-code>

The code to execute, as a string.

\[--skip-wordpress\]

Execute code without loading WordPress.

### [Examples](#examples)

```
# Display WordPress content directory.
$ wp eval 'echo WP_CONTENT_DIR;'
/var/www/wordpress/wp-content

# Generate a random number.
$ wp eval 'echo rand();' --skip-wordpress
479620423
```

### [Global Parameters](#global-parameters)

These [global parameters](https://make.wordpress.org/cli/handbook/config/) have the same behavior across all commands and affect how WP-CLI interacts with WordPress.
